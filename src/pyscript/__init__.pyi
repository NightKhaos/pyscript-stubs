"""
This package contains the main user-facing API offered by pyscript. All the names which are currently made available in
pyscript/__init__.py should be replicated in this interface file. This stub will stick to public methods and ignore
internal methods (i.e. those starting with _). As a rule of thumb if you need access to an internal method you are
probably doing something you should not be.
